## Intro

Ever since I was introduced to music, specifically electronic music, I fell in love. Something about it was so mesmerizing and captivating that it pulled my curiosity in a way that other music hadn’t. The first proper song I was introduced too was [Never Say Never](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS3uxww2WKo&list=RDYS3uxww2WKo) by Armin Van Buuren, an absolute classic. This page is dedicated to not just trance music, but music that resonates with me currently, or did at some special moment and time. 

In 2025 I listened to nearly 90,000 minutes of music on Spotify *alone.* This doesn’t capture any offline listening (e.g old compilations) so I estimate the number to be well over 100,000 minutes!
