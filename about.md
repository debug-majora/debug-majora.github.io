### Hi, hola, or Zdravo! I go by Debug Majora and I am currently a Security Engineer

- with a strong emphasis on Threat Intelligence. My primary interests focus on macOS-related threats, including malware research, threat hunting, detection engineering, and purple teaming.
- outside of security, I have a passion towards animal welfare, and electronic music (trance!). Check out my [music section](http://localhost:4000/music/2026-01-19/) for tunes i’m currently enjoying and visit my [compassion page](/compassion/) to learn about animal welfare, and making our planet a better place for all.
